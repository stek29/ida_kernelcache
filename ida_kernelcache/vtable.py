    """Find the length of a virtual method table.

    This function checks whether the effective address could correspond to a virtual method table
    and calculates its length, including the initial empty entries. By default (when scan is
    False), this function returns the length of the vtable if the address could correspond to a
    vtable, or 0 if the address definitely could not be a vtable.

    Arguments:
        ea: The linear address of the start of the vtable.

    Options:
        end: The end address to search through. Defaults to the end of the section.
        scan: Set to True to indicate that this function is being called to scan memory for virtual
            method tables. Instead of returning the length of the vtable or 0, this function will
            return a tuple (possible, length). Additionally, as a slight optimization, this
            function will sometimes look ahead in order to increase the amount of data that can be
            skipped, reducing duplication of effort between subsequent calls.

    Returns:
        If scan is False (the default), then this function returns the length of the vtable in
        words, including the initial empty entries.

        Otherwise, this function returns a tuple (possible, length). If the address could
        correspond to the start of a vtable, then possible is True and length is the length of the
        vtable in words, including the initial empty entries. Otherwise, if the address is
        definitely not the start of a vtable, then possible is False and length is the number of
        words that can be skipped when searching for the next vtable.
